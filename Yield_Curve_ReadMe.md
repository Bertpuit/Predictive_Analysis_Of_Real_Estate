# Yield Curve Analysis and Its Impact on S&P 500 and Real Estate Markets

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between the yield curve (specifically the spread between 2-year and 10-year Treasury bond yields), the S&P 500 Index, and the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. We investigate how the un-inversion of the yield curve historically correlates with downturns in asset prices, including stock and housing markets.

## Hypothesis
We hypothesize that as the yield curve starts to un-invert, it historically signals a decrease in major asset classes such as the S&P 500 and real estate markets.

## Data Sources
- **Treasury Yields:** Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- **S&P 500 Index:** Yahoo Finance
- **Case-Shiller Home Price Index:** FRED

## Data Exploration and Cleanup
Our Jupyter Notebook details the data exploration and cleanup process:
- Resampling data to monthly frequency
- Calculating yield spread
- Normalizing data for comparative analysis
- Handling missing values and inconsistencies

## Analysis
The analysis includes:
- Time series plotting
- Correlation analysis between yield curve movements and asset class performance
- Statistical analysis to quantify relationships

## Key Findings
- Correlation between yield curve inversions and downturns in S&P 500 and real estate markets
- Periods post-yield curve un-inversion often mark asset price downturns

## Implications
These insights suggest that monitoring yield curve inversions can be crucial for predicting economic cycles and making informed investment decisions.

## Visualizations
Included are time series plots that illustrate the relationships between the yield curve, S&P 500, and real estate markets.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the predictive power of the yield curve on economic cycles and its impact on key asset classes. Our findings serve as a valuable tool for investors in managing portfolio risks and timing investment decisions.

## Storytelling Through Data
Our narrative weaves through the realms of economics and finance, revealing how abstract indicators like the yield curve can profoundly impact real-world asset markets. This journey through data uncovers the interconnectedness of economic indicators and investment risk, offering a roadmap for navigating the complexities of financial markets.
