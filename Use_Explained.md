## Predictive Modeling

- The program uses the existing ROI values as the target variable in a supervised learning context. It learns from other features in your dataset (like location, size, age, etc.) to predict the ROI.
- The purpose is to build a model that can predict the ROI for new, unseen real estate data based on the patterns learned from your current dataset.

## Model Training and Evaluation

- The `RandomForestRegressor` is trained on a portion of your dataset (the training set).
- The model's performance is then evaluated on a separate portion of the data (the test set) using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2). This evaluation helps in understanding how well the model might perform on predicting ROI for new data.

## Feature Importance Analysis

- The program identifies which features (like property size, location, etc.) are most influential in predicting ROI. This analysis is crucial for understanding what drives ROI in your dataset and can inform investment strategies.

## Web Application Interface

- Flask is used to create a web application interface. This allows users to interact with the model and its results through a web page, making the information more accessible and understandable for those not familiar with programming or data analysis tools.

## Not Providing Portfolio Results

- It's important to note that this program is not designed to give you portfolio results or aggregate investment advice. It is focused on individual property ROI predictions based on their characteristics.
