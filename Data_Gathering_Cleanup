Imported necessary libraries such as pandas, pandas_datareader, matplotlib, datetime, and yfinance.
Defined ticker symbols for the 2-year ("DGS2") and 10-year ("DGS10") Treasury bond yields, and other indices like the S&P 500 ("^GSPC") and Case-Shiller Index ("CSUSHPINSA").
Set a date range for data collection, typically from January 1, 2000, to January 1, 2024.
Fetching Data:

Utilized pandas_datareader to fetch data for the 2-year and 10-year Treasury bond yields from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED).
Used yfinance to download the S&P 500 data.
Ensured data alignment on the same dates for yield data and S&P 500 Index.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Dropped rows with NaN values in the Treasury yield datasets to ensure data integrity.
Calculated the yield spread by subtracting the 2-year yield from the 10-year yield.
Normalized the S&P 500 data and yield spread for comparison purposes.
Resampled the data to a monthly frequency to standardize the time frames across different datasets.
Checked and handled any missing values or discrepancies in the dates across the datasets.
Merging and Aligning Data:

Merged the yield data with the Case-Shiller Index data based on the date to analyze them together.
Ensured the indices of both the yield data and Case-Shiller data were aligned, converting them to the same date format if necessary.
Data Exploration:

Generated descriptive statistics to understand the distributions, averages, and other statistical measures.
Explored correlations between the yield spread, S&P 500, and Case-Shiller Index.
Created scatter plots and histograms to visualize relationships and distributions.
Visualization:

Used matplotlib to create visualizations such as line plots, bar charts, and histograms.
Plotted the yield curve spread over time, as well as its relation to the S&P 500 and Case-Shiller Index.
Created separate plots for clarity and better data representation.
Additional Analysis:

Conducted further exploration by creating moving averages of the yields to observe long-term trends.
Investigated specific periods of interest, like times of economic downturn or growth, to see how they affected the bond market and other indices.
